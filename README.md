<br>

📌 Project Overview
<br>
This project aims to analyze patient health data and build a predictive model for diabetes risk using Machine Learning in R. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature correlation analysis, and a predictive model using Random Forest. The model helps identify key factors contributing to diabetes and evaluates its predictive performance.
<br>

🛠 Methodology
<br>
🔹 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values
Converted categorical variables into factors
Scaled numerical variables
<br>
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histograms & Boxplots: Visualized key trends (e.g., Age vs. Diabetes, BMI distribution)
Correlation Heatmap: Identified strong correlations among features
<br>
🔹 Machine Learning Model (Random Forest)
Split data into 80% training and 20% testing
Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict diabetes risk
<br>

Evaluated model performance using:
<br>
✅ Confusion Matrix (Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity)
<br>
✅ ROC Curve (AUC Score)
<br>
🔹 Feature Importance Analysis
Identified top predictors of diabetes using feature importance ranking
<br>
🔹 Results & Interpretation
Exported predictions & model performance metrics
<br>

📌 Key Findings & Insights
<br>
✔ Top 5 Risk Factors for Diabetes:
<br>
1️⃣ Age – Older individuals have a higher likelihood of diabetes
<br>
2️⃣ BMI – Higher BMI correlates with diabetes risk
<br>
3️⃣ HbA1c Levels – A critical indicator of long-term blood sugar control
<br>
4️⃣ Hypertension (Blood Pressure) – Strongly linked with diabetes
<br>
5️⃣ Family History of Diabetes – Increases the probability significantly
<br>

✔ Healthy Lifestyle Factors:
<br>
Physical Activity & Diet Quality reduce diabetes risk
<br>
Poor Sleep Quality & Smoking are associated with increased risk
<br>
✔ Model Performance:
<br>
Accuracy: 92%
<br>
AUC Score: 0.95 (High Predictive Power)
