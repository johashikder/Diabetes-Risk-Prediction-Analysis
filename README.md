# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction-Analysis
🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction & Analysis
Author: Sams | Language: R | Dataset: Patient Health Data

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze patient health data and build a predictive model for diabetes risk using Machine Learning in R. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature correlation analysis, and a predictive model using Random Forest. The model helps identify key factors contributing to diabetes and evaluates its predictive performance.

🛠 Methodology
🔹 1. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values
Converted categorical variables into factors
Scaled numerical variables
🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histograms & Boxplots: Visualized key trends (e.g., Age vs. Diabetes, BMI distribution)
Correlation Heatmap: Identified strong correlations among features
🔹 3. Machine Learning Model (Random Forest)
Split data into 80% training and 20% testing
Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict diabetes risk
Evaluated model performance using:
✅ Confusion Matrix (Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity)
✅ ROC Curve (AUC Score)
🔹 4. Feature Importance Analysis
Identified top predictors of diabetes using feature importance ranking
🔹 5. Results & Interpretation
Exported predictions & model performance metrics

📌 Key Findings & Insights
✔ Top 5 Risk Factors for Diabetes:
1️⃣ Age – Older individuals have a higher likelihood of diabetes
2️⃣ BMI – Higher BMI correlates with diabetes risk
3️⃣ HbA1c Levels – A critical indicator of long-term blood sugar control
4️⃣ Hypertension (Blood Pressure) – Strongly linked with diabetes
5️⃣ Family History of Diabetes – Increases the probability significantly

✔ Healthy Lifestyle Factors:

Physical Activity & Diet Quality reduce diabetes risk
Poor Sleep Quality & Smoking are associated with increased risk
✔ Model Performance:

Accuracy: 92%
AUC Score: 0.95 (High Predictive Power)
